# Revision 1.50  1996/01/15  14:47:16  andrewm
# More portability glitches (needed to reset interpreter result
# in TkEntryInsert routines).
#
# Revision 1.49  1996/01/13  18:31:51  andrewm
# Dumb typos in tkCmds.c - found when build under SunOS.
#
# Revision 1.48  1995/12/21  19:31:05  andrewm
# Added "ctk redraw" command.
#
# Revision 1.47  1995/12/20  22:22:00  andrewm
# (bug fix) made ctkDisplay.c 8-bit clean (wasn't casting char
# to unsigned char) - thanks Jan Vlcek.
#
# Revision 1.46  1995/12/20  21:13:04  andrewm
# Incorporate changes from Tk4.0 patch 3 (tk4.0p3).
#
# Revision 1.45  1995/12/20  16:28:09  andrewm
# Incorporate changes from tk4.0 patch 2.
#
# Revision 1.44  1995/12/04  19:57:27  andrewm
# (bug fix) tkListbox.c - display cursor even when active row is not
# visible (put it in the top left corner).
#
# (feature change) tkListbox.c - no longer display "*" next to selected
# items - rely on display attribute instead.
#
# (feature change) listbox.tcl - Left and Right now scroll by pages
# instead of characters.
#
# Revision 1.43  1995/12/04  19:19:52  andrewm
# bug fix - forgot to change var name when pasting code into tk_popup.
#
# Revision 1.42  1995/11/19  17:07:16  andrewm
# Incorporate changes from Tk4.0 patch 1.
#
# Revision 1.41  1995/11/17  15:35:49  andrewm
# Drop use of A_INVIS in ctkDisplay.c - those styles should never be
# drawn anyway - and most terms don't support it (and it screws up
# out terminal session manager).
#
# Revision 1.40  1995/11/06  13:31:19  andrewm
# Change TK_PATCH_LEVEL to CTK_PATCH_LEVEL and tcl variable tk_patchLevel
# with ctk_patchLevel.  Only version numbers track between Tk and CTk -
# and this make for an easy way to tell when you are using CTk.
#
# Add Tk_RestackWindow() and pull stacking arguments out of Tk_Map() -
# now raise and lower commands use Tk_RestackWindow instead of Ctk_Map
# (because they should not map unmapped windows).
#
# The CTk menu now underlines the X in Exit (not the E).
#
# Revision 1.39  1995/08/31  19:48:54  andrewm
# Make sure that all uses of ckalloc/ckfree are with (char *) pointers
# (cast when necessary).
#
# Install as version 4.0 - don't need a different library for each patch.
#
# Revision 1.38  1995/08/25  20:38:47  andrewm
# bug fix - finally track down glitch that caused some slaves to not
# be mapped - backwards logic in tkGeometry.c.
#
# aesthetics - tk_dialog now uses a simpler appearance for the default
# button (add [] to label instead of an enclosing frame).
#
# Revision 1.37  1995/08/25  18:41:19  andrewm
# Change tkFindMenu to that it only finds menubuttons that do not
# have an indicator (otherwise the F10 key will fire menus of
# options buttons).
#
# Add exit to Ctk menu.
#
# Revision 1.36  1995/08/24  17:50:35  andrewm
# Add compatibilty info to tk.h to simplify porting of Tk extensions
# to ctk (BLT table was easy!).
#
# Revision 1.35  1995/08/22  19:48:01  andrewm
# Fix bug when destroying all windows from within a command from
# an event binding (could core dump).
#
# Revision 1.34  1995/08/22  17:31:37  andrewm
# Add ability for multi-column (wrapped) menus.
#
# Change menu button indicator to "^" (was "=").
#
# Revision 1.33  1995/08/21  21:39:57  andrewm
# More logical key fixes - no longer bind directly to "space" - instead
# bind to Select, and remap space to Select.
#
# Make Return a do-what-I-want key instead of the dialog closure key
# (which is now Execute).
#
# Curses Enter/Send key now maps to KP_Enter, not Return.
#
# Revision 1.32  1995/08/21  20:47:50  andrewm
# Remove root window from name table after creating "." window -
# otherwise user can reference the root, which can cause core dumps.
#
# Change bindings to use logical key names only - then central
# ctk.tcl binds other keys to generate logical key events.
#
# Add ctk_event command (ala testevent).
#
# Revision 1.31  1995/08/21  14:52:49  andrewm
# Fix foolish change to text/entry insertion - back to Insert procefdure
# returning a boolean.
#
# Revision 1.30  1995/08/21  13:30:49  andrewm
# Pull out the menu traversal by matching first label character - decide
# it better belongs in a library.
#
# Revision 1.29  1995/08/18  21:58:02  andrewm
# Modify bindings within menu to activate entries by pressing the first
# letter of their label.
#
# Revision 1.28  1995/08/18  19:56:34  andrewm
# Rewite the tkEntryInsert and tkEntrySeeInsert procedures in C.
# Not sure if the payoff is worth it this time.
#
# Revision 1.27  1995/08/18  14:15:35  andrewm
# Rewrite the tk_focusNext and tk_focusPrev procedures in C, because
# their overhead was annoying on loaded server machines - particularly
# if you overshoot a widget and have not Shift-Tab on your terminal!

# "option" command.

5/5/95 (bug fix) Modify command.tcl so that commands are evaluated
in a global context.

--- ctk4.0a2 Released ---

5/4/95 (bug fix) Modify configure.in to check for gettimeofday() -
if it doesn't exist add the socket library (for SCO).

5/4/95 (new feature) Modify ctkDisplay.c so that the environment
variable CTK_TERM can override the TERM environment variable (to
allow terminal definitions customized for CTk).

5/3/95 (new feature) Add ctkDialog for interactive cwish sessions.  Modify
tkMain.c so that it calls ctkDialog instead of reading commands from
stdin when the user doesn't redirect the display.

5/3/95 (feature change) Modify tkCmds.c so that widget bindings come before
class bindings.  (Patch from Dr. Ousterhout.)
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

4/22/95 (bug fix) Modify tkFont.c and and tkTextDisp.c so that cursor
is drawn in entry and text widgets when the insertion point is in front
of a tab character.

4/22/95 (new feature) Add scrollbar.tcl for scrollbar keyboard bindings and
modify tkScrollbar.c to highlight when the scrollbar has the focus.
(But scrollbars default to "-takefocus 0".)

4/22/95 (feature change) Modify tkMain.c and tkWindow.c to change
the environment variable that specifies display terminal to CTK_DISPLAY
(CWISH_DISPLAY will still work but it is deprecated and support for it
will eventually be removed).
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

4/22/95 (feature change) Modify listbox.tcl so that PageUp and PageDown
key bindings change the active element.

4/6/95 (many fixes & features) Incorporate tk4.0b3 changes.
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

3/23/95 (bug fix) Modified tkWindow so that Tk_CreateMainWindow()
will not pass a null argument (screen) to the "frame" command -
this was the real cause of the NULL dereference I tried to fix on
3/20/95 - undo that first fix.

3/21/95 (new feature) Modify tkFrame.c, tkListbox.c, tkText.c, and
tkTextDisp.c to highlight the border of frame, listbox, and text
widgets when they have the focus.

3/20/95 (bug fix) Modified tkConfig.c so that DoConfig() wouldn't
dereference a NULL value (thanks Peter da Silva).

3/20/95 (bug fix) Modified tkWindow.c to destroy top-level children of
main window (missed them before, and therefore wouldn't close display).

3/15/95 (new feature) Modify ctkDisplay.c to put terminals in raw mode
so that interrupt, quit, etc are passed as keys instead of generating
signals.

3/13/95 (bug fix) Modified tkTextMark.c to no longer dump core when the
insert mark wraps across lines (put back InsertUndisplayProc() - why
I removed it in the first place I have no idea).

9/20/96 (port) Port ctk to tcl7.6: event handling (remove from ctk, call
tcl's), channel handling. Should be better to reorganize code and
merge in tk4.2 as another platform (Curses) -- Juanjo <jjciarla@raiz.uncu.edu.ar>

7/16/97 (port) Port ctk to tcl8.0: change ctk.tcl to expect a higher version of tcl/tk.
Still needs "grid" and a number of other enhancements. Michael (mschwart@nyx.net)
