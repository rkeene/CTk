This directory contains a collection of programs to demonstrate
the features of the CTk toolkit.  The programs are all scripts for
"cwish", a windowing shell.  If cwish has been installed in /usr/local
then you can invoke any of the programs in this directory just
by typing its file name to your command shell.  Otherwise invoke
wish with the file as its first argument, e.g., "cwish hello".
The rest of this file contains a brief description of each program.

stuff -		Chaotic demonstration of the widgets currently available
		in the CTk library.

hello -		Creates a single button;  if you click on it, a message
		is typed and the application terminates.

widget -	Rough port of Tk's widget demo.  Still has lots of holes.
		Most of the .tcl files are scripts for individual demos
		available through the "widget" program.

rolodex -	A mock-up of a simple rolodex application.  It has much of
		the user interface for such an application but no back-end
		database.  This program was written in response to Tom
		LaStrange's toolkit benchmark challenge.
